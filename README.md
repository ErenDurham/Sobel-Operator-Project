## Part 1: Unsigned Multiplication

### Objective
Develop an assembly routine without the use of multiplication and pseudoinstructions to multiply two unsigned 32-bit numbers using the RISC-V RV32I ISA. The system must output the lower 32 least significant bits of the product.

### Algorithm
The implementation optimized for execution speed and compactness. The routine implemented a shift-and-add algorithm to perform the calculation efficiently.

### Output
The final 32-bit result was stored in the designated memory word c.

## Part 2: Sobel Operator

### Objective
Developed an assembly routine to apply the Sobel operator to a 5x5 matrix of signed 32-bit numbers using the RV32I ISA. This operation approximates derivatives for horizontal and vertical changes in image processing by performing convolutions with specific kernels.

### Kernel Definitions
$$
G_x = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
-1 & 0 & +1 \\ 
-2 & 0 & +2 \\ 
-1 & 0 & +1 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$
G_y = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
-1 & -2 & -1 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
+1 & +2 & +1 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Convolution Process
The convolution involves sweeping a 3x3 kernel across the 5x5 source matrix with a stride of 1.

1. Select a 3x3 window from the source matrix.
2. Perform multiplication between the source window and the kernel.
3. Sum the resulting values to generate a single output element.
4. Shift the window by the stride and repeat until the entire matrix is processed.

For example, using a source matrix A and kernel B, the first operation aligns the top-left 3x3 window of A with B, computes the products, and sums them to create the first entry of the output.

### Final Output Computation
The Sobel filter requires the convolution of the source matrix with both Gx and Gy independently. The final output is generated by combining these two results.

Add the output matrix from the Gx convolution to the output matrix from the Gy convolution element-wise.

$C_{final}[row][col] = Result_{Gx}[row][col] + Result_{Gy}[row][col]$

### Output
The resulting 3x3 matrix must be stored in the memory word array c.
